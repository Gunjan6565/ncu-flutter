A professor went to a party. Being an erudite person, he classified the party into two categories. He proposed that if all the persons in the party are wearing different colored robes, then that is a girl’s only party. If we even get one duplicate color, it must be a boy’s party. The colors of the robes are represented by positive integers.
Input The first line of each test case contains an integer T, denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of people in the party. In the next line are N space separated values of Ai denoting the color of the robes.
Output For each test case, print “BOYS” without quotes if it’s a boy’s party, else print “GIRLS”


i/p: 1 2 3 4 7
o/p: girls

i/p: 1 3 2 4 5 1
o/p: boys


Problem-2
(Asked By Samsung)
Shaggy has a frog Akki. Akki is very hungry and Shaggy decides to feed it by playing a little game. Akki is a special frog which can jump as far as it wants but has a special pattern: He starts at the point 0.
In his first turn, he can make a jump of 1 unit. Now for all consequent turns, if the frog is currently at a distance x (from the start), his jump will take him x units forward. Given a leaf at a distance N , you have to find if the frog can reach that leaf or not.
Input
* The first line contains number of test cases 'T' followed by 'T' non-negative integer 'x' denoting the distance.
Output:
* Output contains T line containing,for each test cases True if the frog Akki can reach that pillar and print False otherwise.


Example:
Input:
3 1 7 64
Output:
True False True


Problem -3
Find the Missing Number
You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8} Output: 5
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5} Output: 4

Problem-4
Given an integer array A that contains only integers 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array. Find a solution which scans the array only once. Don't use extra array.
You need to change in the given array itself. So no need to return or print anything.
Input format :
Sample Input :
7
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
Sample Output :
0 0 0 1 1 1 1

Problem-5
Anagram String
“listen” “silent”

Problem-6

Input: abcdabaa
Output : a occur 4 times

Problem - 7 Find the Leader Element in an Array
Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {300,40,60,90,100,12,16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 300,100,17, 5 and 2.
